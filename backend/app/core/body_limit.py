"""Request body size limit that also covers bodies sent without Content-Length.

Checking only the Content-Length header misses chunked uploads, which the server would
otherwise buffer whole before validation rejects them. This ASGI middleware reads the body
up to the limit, answers 413 beyond it, and replays the buffered body to the app. The API
takes small JSON bodies (a claim and its context), so buffering them is cheap.
